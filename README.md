## Demo

https://djreactjwt-1-n3165612.deta.app

## Backend

- django
- djangorestframework
- djangorestframework-simplejwt

## Frontend

- react
- react-router-dom
- redux-toolkit (RTK)
- TailwindCSS

## Deployment

> I deployed this project on [Deta Space](https://deta.space/), a free hosting website for both backend and frontend. The deta space uses a configuration file named Spacefile in yaml format. The [SpacefileExample](https://github.com/crazy-man22/django-react-jwt-auth/blob/main/SpacefileExample) here is an example and actual file for this project deployment. I think you can use this configuration file for django-react project deployment.

> Personally, I love [Deta Space](https://deta.space/), It's a Heroku alternative. Deta is more developer friendly. I recommend you trying to use it.
